* Task 1
** Problem Statement
Assuming there are "N" number of devices(having Linux on them) of type "X" where N > 0, out there in the field(distributed devices all over the world with limited internet connectivity, so they are not in same network. Example - a mobile phone, a raspberry pi) .Each device has two types of network interfaces - One is Ethernet port and second is wireless interface(wifi adapter) . Each interface would have a MAC address.
*** Case 1:
We have to build a system to collect information from the device at regular interval.
How would you model the system to make this happen?
Following can be the type of information we are collecting from the devices -
- Average cpu usage per/day
- Average memory used per/day
- disk space of the device
- ethernet mac id
- wifi interface mac id
**** Solution:
Since the have limited access to internet, we could have a metrics/information gathering agent running on the devices
 and a service infrastructure to collect this metrics when devices come online.
